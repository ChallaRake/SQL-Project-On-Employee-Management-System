## 🔍 Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a structured **Employee Management System** using **SQL** to manage employee data efficiently. The system handles personal details, job roles, salaries, qualifications, leave records, and payroll.

## 🎯 Project Objective
- **Design** a normalized relational database schema with key modules for employees, departments, salaries, leaves, qualifications, and payroll.
- **Ensure** data integrity using foreign keys and cascading updates.
- **Analyze** organizational data through SQL queries to uncover trends in compensation, leave usage, and performance growth.
- **Streamline** HR operations with meaningful KPIs for salary allocation, job roles, and departmental insights.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Database**: MySQL / PostgreSQL (or any RDBMS)
- **Query Language**: Structured Query Language (SQL)
- **Design**: ER Diagrams, Relational Schema
- **Data Volume**: Simulated data for over 100 employees across 6 core tables
